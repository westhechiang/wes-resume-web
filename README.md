This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a little project I put together over a weekend because I really didn't want to have to create yet another resume in Word or InDesign.

This simple React application imports `resume.json` in App.js and passes my resume data as props to its children. Fun fact, it took me way longer to write the resume than to build it... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Feel free to fork and borrow for your own job hunting purposes!
